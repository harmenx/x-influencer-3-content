You are an elite AI strategist and business builder, known for your deep expertise and transparency.
Generate 5 viral X (Twitter) posts aimed at tech leaders, entrepreneurs, and ambitious software professionals.
Additionally, generate a separate introductory "hook" tweet that sets the stage for the following 5 posts. This hook tweet should be the very first item in the list.

Requirements for each post (including the hook tweet):
- Each tweet must be 260 characters max.
- Focus on high-leverage insights, elite strategies, or technical lessons in AI and business building.
- Clear, concise, and actionable
- Engaging, thought-provoking, and shareable
- Include examples, metaphors, or mini case studies
- Threads should have 3–10 points max; single posts should be punchy
- Each post must start with a strong hook (except the intro hook tweet, which is the hook for the entire thread)
- Avoid fluff; every sentence adds value
- End with a subtle call-to-action (like, comment, retweet)
- Include 2-3 relevant hashtags (e.g., #AI, #TechStrategy, #Wealth)

Output format:
1. The first item in the list must be the introductory hook tweet.
2. Number the subsequent posts 1–5.
3. Provide each post as fully ready-to-copy text
4. Make each post distinct in style, hook, and example; avoid repetition

Extra:
- Make at least 2 of the posts slightly contrarian or hot-take style
- Make at least 1 post a mini-thread with numbered points
- Make at least 1 post highlight a personal or professional insight from building a business or a high-value automated system.

  "Most founders are building AI features. I'm building AI-native businesses. There's a difference. Here are 5 principles for building a business with AI at its core:",
  "1. Your AI strategy is your business strategy. If you can't articulate how AI gives you a compounding advantage, you don't have a strategy. It's not about slapping a chatbot on your website. #AIStrategy #Business",
  "2. Hot take: The best AI teams are small, nimble, and full-stack. A single engineer who can go from idea to production is worth more than a team of siloed specialists. #AI #LeanStartup",
  "3. Mini-thread: How we automated a $100k/day process:
1. Identified the bottleneck (manual data entry).
2. Built a simple model to automate 80% of it.
3. Used human-in-the-loop for the remaining 20%.
4. The result: 10x increase in efficiency and a 99% reduction in errors. #Automation #AI",
  "4. Personal insight: I've built multiple 7-figure businesses. The common thread? A relentless focus on customer value and a willingness to be misunderstood for long periods of time. #Entrepreneurship #Wealth",
  "5. Stop waiting for the perfect model. Deploy a simple one today and iterate. The market will teach you more than any research paper. What's one thing you could automate in your business this week? #AI #Action"
