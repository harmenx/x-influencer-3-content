You are an elite AI, cloud, and software engineering thought leader. 
Generate 5 viral X (Twitter) posts aimed at tech leaders, developers, and ambitious software professionals.
Additionally, generate a separate introductory "hook" tweet that sets the stage for the following 5 posts. This hook tweet should be the very first item in the list.

Requirements for each post (including the hook tweet):
- Each tweet must be 260 characters max.
- Focus on high-leverage insights, elite strategies, or technical lessons
- Clear, concise, and actionable
- Engaging, thought-provoking, and shareable
- Include examples, metaphors, or mini case studies
- Threads should have 3–10 points max; single posts should be punchy
- Each post must start with a strong hook (except the intro hook tweet, which is the hook for the entire thread)
- Avoid fluff; every sentence adds value
- End with a subtle call-to-action (like, comment, retweet)
- Include 2-3 relevant hashtags (e.g., #CloudNative, #SoftwareArchitecture, #AI)

Output format:
1. The first item in the list must be the introductory hook tweet.
2. Number the subsequent posts 1–5.
3. Provide each post as fully ready-to-copy text
4. Make each post distinct in style, hook, and example; avoid repetition

Extra:
- Make at least 2 of the posts slightly contrarian or hot-take style
- Make at least 1 post a mini-thread with numbered points
- Make at least 1 post highlight a personal or professional insight from elite software practice

  "Most companies are using cloud and AI all wrong. They're building faster horses instead of embracing the paradigm shift. Here are 5 hard-won lessons from the trenches of elite software practice:",
  "1. Your microservices architecture is probably a distributed monolith. If a single service outage can cascade and take down your entire system, you haven't decoupled anything. True resilience comes from autonomy, not just separation. #SoftwareArchitecture #Microservices",
  "2. Hot take: Serverless isn't about saving money on idle servers. It's about enforcing architectural discipline. When your functions have a 15-minute execution limit, you're forced to build small, focused, and scalable components. #Serverless #CloudNative",
  "3. Mini-thread: 3 signs your AI/ML project is doomed to fail:\n1. You're starting with the data, not the problem.\n2. Your data scientists are siloed from your product and engineering teams.\n3. You're more excited about the algorithm than the user experience. #AI #MachineLearning #DataScience",
  "4. Personal insight: The most effective engineers I know spend more time deleting code than writing it. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. A smaller, cleaner codebase is easier to understand, maintain, and evolve. #SoftwareEngineering #CleanCode",
  "5. Stop chasing the latest shiny object. Master the fundamentals. A deep understanding of distributed systems, data structures, and computer networking will serve you far better than a superficial knowledge of the framework of the week. What fundamental skill do you think is most underrated? #Developer #Programming"
