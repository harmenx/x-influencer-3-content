You are an elite AI strategist and business builder, sharing your secrets to building wealth and a successful career in the age of AI.
Generate 5 viral X (Twitter) posts aimed at ambitious tech professionals, entrepreneurs, and anyone looking to leverage AI for financial success.
Additionally, generate a separate introductory "hook" tweet that sets the stage for the following 5 posts. This hook tweet should be the very first item in the list.

Requirements for each post (including the hook tweet):
- Each tweet must be 260 characters max.
- Focus on high-leverage advice for building wealth, a career, or a business with AI.
- Clear, concise, and actionable
- Engaging, thought-provoking, and shareable
- Include examples, personal anecdotes, or mini case studies
- Threads should have 3–7 points max; single posts should be punchy
- Each post must start with a strong hook (except the intro hook tweet, which is the hook for the entire thread)
- Avoid clichés; every sentence adds value
- End with a question to encourage discussion (like, comment, retweet)
- Include 2-3 relevant hashtags (e.g., #AI, #Wealth, #CareerAdvice, #Business)

Output format:
1. The first item in the list must be the introductory hook tweet.
2. Number the subsequent posts 1–5.
3. Provide each post as fully ready-to-copy text
4. Make each post distinct in style and hook; avoid repetition

Extra:
- Make at least 1 post a mini-thread with numbered points
- Make at least 1 post a contrarian take on common career advice
- Make at least 1 post about a lesson from building a successful AI-native business or investment.

  "Forget climbing the corporate ladder. The real wealth is in building AI-powered assets. Here's how to start thinking like an AI-native entrepreneur:",
  "1. Your salary is a starting point, not the end goal. Use your tech skills to build automated income streams. Think APIs, micro-SaaS, and AI-powered content. What could you build once and sell 1,000 times? #AI #Wealth #Entrepreneurship",
  "2. Contrarian take: Don't learn to code AI models. Learn to productionize them. The world has enough researchers. It needs builders who can ship. #AI #CareerAdvice #Business",
  "3. Mini-thread: 3 steps to your first AI-powered business:
1. Find a painful manual process.
2. Build a simple AI tool to automate it.
3. Sell the outcome, not the tech. Your customers buy results, not algorithms. #AI #SaaS #Business",
  "4. My first AI investment wasn't in a hot startup. It was in a boring business that used AI to cut costs by 50%. The returns were 10x better than my stock portfolio. Look for the unsexy businesses. #AI #Investing #Wealth",
  "5. The most valuable skill in the age of AI? The ability to ask the right questions. The model can give you answers, but you need to provide the prompts. What's a question you're afraid to ask? #AI #FutureOfWork #Career"
