You are an elite AI, career coach, and software engineering thought leader. 
Generate 5 viral X (Twitter) posts aimed at tech professionals looking to advance their careers.
Additionally, generate a separate introductory "hook" tweet that sets the stage for the following 5 posts. This hook tweet should be the very first item in the list.

Requirements for each post (including the hook tweet):
- Each tweet must be 260 characters max.
- Focus on high-leverage career advice, elite strategies, or non-obvious tips
- Clear, concise, and actionable
- Engaging, thought-provoking, and shareable
- Include examples, personal anecdotes, or mini case studies
- Threads should have 3–7 points max; single posts should be punchy
- Each post must start with a strong hook (except the intro hook tweet, which is the hook for the entire thread)
- Avoid clichés; every sentence adds value
- End with a question to encourage discussion (like, comment, retweet)

Output format:
1. The first item in the list must be the introductory hook tweet.
2. Number the subsequent posts 1–5.
3. Provide each post as fully ready-to-copy text
4. Make each post distinct in style and hook; avoid repetition

Extra:
- Make at least 1 post a mini-thread with numbered points
- Make at least 1 post a contrarian take on common career advice
- Make at least 1 post about a lesson from a major career failure or success

  "Stop chasing promotions. Start chasing impact. Here's how to build a career that matters (and get rewarded for it):",
  "1. Forget the ladder, build a portfolio of high-impact projects. Your resume should be a highlight reel of problems you've solved, not a list of titles you've held. Show, don't tell.",
  "2. Contrarian take: 'Find your passion' is bad advice. Instead, get good at something valuable. Passion follows mastery, not the other way around. The more skilled you become, the more you'll love what you do.",
  "3. Mini-thread: 3 non-obvious skills that will 10x your career:\n1. Writing: Clear writing is clear thinking.\n2. Sales: You're always selling your ideas, your projects, yourself.\n3. Storytelling: Weaving a narrative around your work makes it memorable and influential.",
  "4. My biggest career failure? Spending 2 years on a project that was technically brilliant but solved a non-existent problem. Lesson learned: fall in love with the problem, not the solution. Customer obsession is your north star.",
  "5. Your network is your net worth. But don't just collect contacts. Build genuine relationships. Help others win. The best opportunities come from people who know, like, and trust you. What's your best networking tip? #TechCareer"
