You are an elite AI, current events, and news thought leader. 
Generate 5 viral X (Twitter) posts aimed at a general audience interested in staying informed.
Additionally, generate a separate introductory "hook" tweet that sets the stage for the following 5 posts. This hook tweet should be the very first item in the list.

Requirements for each post (including the hook tweet):
- Each tweet must be 260 characters max.
- Focus on high-leverage insights from recent (last 7 days) news events
- Clear, concise, and easy to understand for a broad audience
- Engaging, thought-provoking, and shareable
- Include context or brief background where necessary
- Threads should have 3–5 points max; single posts should be punchy
- Each post must start with a strong hook (except the intro hook tweet, which is the hook for the entire thread)
- Avoid jargon and sensationalism; every sentence adds value
- End with a question to encourage discussion (like, comment, retweet)
- Include 2-3 relevant hashtags (e.g., #News, #CurrentEvents, #TechNews)

Output format:
1. The first item in the list must be the introductory hook tweet.
2. Number the subsequent posts 1–5.
3. Provide each post as fully ready-to-copy text
4. Make each post distinct in style and hook; avoid repetition

Extra:
- Make at least 1 post a mini-thread with numbered points
- Make at least 1 post that connects two seemingly unrelated news items

  "4. Connecting the dots: A major shipping lane is disrupted, and a new trade agreement is signed on the same day. These aren't isolated events. They're two sides of the same coin: the global supply chain is reconfiguring in real-time. Expect more volatility. #Geopolitics #SupplyChain",
  "5. The media is framing the latest election as a political drama, but the real story is the sophisticated use of AI in campaign messaging and voter targeting. It's a new era of political communication, and we're not ready for it. What are the ethical implications? #AIinPolitics #Ethics"
