1. **Single post (contrarian hot-take):**  
"Your *clean code obsession* is killing your velocity.  
Code doesn’t need to be 'pretty'—it needs to ship and solve problems.  
The best engineers know:  
- Optimize for readability, not perfection.  
- Refactor **after** you’ve validated value.  
- 'Technical debt' is often a *business investment*.  
Ship first. Polish later.

2. **Mini-thread (personal insight):**  
"After 10 years in software, here’s my #1 lesson: **The best engineers aren’t the smartest—they’re the most *systematic*.**  

Here’s how elite devs think differently:  

1️⃣ **Architecture is a multiplier.**  
Every shortcut in your foundation costs 10x later. Build for scalability—not just speed.  

2️⃣ **They invest in documentation.**  
A well-documented API is like a treasure map for your team. Clarity = velocity.  

3️⃣ **They prioritize deep work.**  
Slack notifications don’t build great software. Block time, focus, and let the code flow.  

4️⃣ **They debug like detectives.**  
Don’t guess—trace the crime scene. The root cause is always hiding in plain sight.  

5️⃣ **They mentor others.**  
Sharing knowledge scales your impact. The more your team grows, the more you win.

3. **Single post (technical insight)**  
"The most underrated *skill* in software?  
👉 Writing great commit messages.  

Why? Because a good commit message turns chaos into clarity:  
- Helps future devs understand *why* a change was made.  
- Speeds up debugging by making history traceable.  
- Makes code reviews 10x easier.  

Pro tip: Use this format:  
1️⃣ **What:** Describe the change.  
2️⃣ **Why:** Explain the reason.  
3️⃣ **How:** Mention any approach or key details.  

Example:  
'Fix authentication bug (What). Users couldn’t log in due to expired tokens (Why). Updated OAuth flow to auto-refresh tokens (How).'  

A great codebase starts with great commit history. 🚀
